# 1. Introduction
I've been enjoying [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/) for the past few weeks, particularly how smooth the Python API feels. With its impressive speed and friendly SQL interface, analyzing moderately large datasets within a Jupyter Notebook is almost effortless. This project aims to demonstrate just how excited I am to use and to learn more about this incredible tool.

The analysis presented here is solely focused on the [FIMA NFIP Redacted Claims](https://www.fema.gov/openfema-data-page/fima-nfip-redacted-claims-v2) dataset, which fortunately is available in Parquet format. With more than 2M rows, this dataset provides detailed information about the [National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)](https://www.floodsmart.gov/about) claims transations and is redated to protect policy holders.

Given the substantial size of this dataset, it provided an opportunity to explore and utilize DuckDB, a high-performance analytical database. While this guide offers valuable insights, users are encouraged to supplement their understanding by referring to the [official documentation](https://duckdb.org/docs/) provided on DuckDB's website.
